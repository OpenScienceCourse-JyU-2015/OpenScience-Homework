* General comments

- Code indentation: it is usually used to denote specific blocks such as *for*
  loops or *if* and *else* conditional blocks. Avoid using indentation to
  separate "sections" of your analysis as it might be confusing for other
  readers - use comments with the emphasis of your choice to denote section
  titles, for example:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # *** Section 1 ***

  # Assign variable
  x <- 1:10

  # *** Section 2 ***

  # Graph
  plot(x)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Cleaning the dataset

- Curating was thoroughly done, good job!
- When removing "weird" values, try to make your code robust, i.e. still
  working if the input file is updated later. For example, if there is a tree
  with an impossible height (832 meters), use:
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  trees$height[trees$height > 200] = NA
  #+END_SRC
  instead of:
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  trees$height[trees$height == 832] = NA
  #+END_SRC
  The second version only works for weird values at 832 meters, the first one
  works for all values above 200 meters.
